#summary This pages explains how to compile the firmware

Up to now the firmware has only be compiled under Linux. This page thus only describes the necessary Linux setup. Windows instructions are welcome.

= Prerequisites =

The firmware is written in C. Thus a matching C compiler is needed. The current firmware setup expects a matching version of the gnu compiler collection (GCC) to be installed as desribed in [http://retroramblings.net/?p=315 this blog posting]. A [http://mist-board.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/install_arm-none-eabi-gcc.sh shell script] is available to automate the setup.

= Compiling =

The firmware source code is available from the [http://code.google.com/p/mist-board/source/checkout MIST svn repository].

Once the compiler is installed a simple `make` in the firmware subdirectory will build the latest firmware.

= Installation =

Three files are generated during compilation:

  * *firmware.bin* is the raw binary of the firmware. This can be uploaded to the MIST board using special flashers
  * *firmware.hex* is the same firmware in intel hex format as required by some uploaders
  * *firmware.upg* is the same firmware in a format suited for self-update via the on-screen-display (OSD)
